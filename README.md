# AeroQSense – Smart Air Quality Monitoring System 🌬️🌱

---

## Project Overview

AeroQSense is an advanced **Air Quality Index (AQI) monitoring system** designed to track, analyze, and visualize environmental pollutants in real-time. Using a combination of IoT sensors and cloud-based analytics, it provides actionable insights to improve environmental awareness and support decision-making.

The system monitors pollutants like **PM2.5, PM10, CO2, and NOx**, performs predictive analytics on air quality trends, and displays results on a **real-time interactive dashboard**.
